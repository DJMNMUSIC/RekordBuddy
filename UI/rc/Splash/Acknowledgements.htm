	GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	Version 3, 29 June 2007
</p>
<p>
	Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</p>
<p>
	Preamble
</p>
<p>
	The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
	software and other kinds of works.
</p>
<p>
	The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
	the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
	software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
	GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
	any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
	your programs, too.
</p>
<p>
	When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
	want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
	free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
</p>
<p>
	To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
	these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
	certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
	you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
	freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
	or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
	know their rights.
</p>
<p>
	Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
	(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
	giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
</p>
<p>
	For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
	that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
	authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
	changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
	authors of previous versions.
</p>
<p>
	Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
	modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
	can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
	protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
	pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
	use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
	have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
	products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
	stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
	of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
	States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
	software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
	avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
	make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
	patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
</p>
<p>
	The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.
</p>
<p>
	TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>
<p>
	0. Definitions.
</p>
<p>
	"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
</p>
<p>
	"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
	works, such as semiconductor masks.
</p>
<p>
	"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
	License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
	"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
</p>
<p>
	To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
	in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
	earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
</p>
<p>
	A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
	on the Program.
</p>
<p>
	To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
	permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
	infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
	computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
	distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
	public, and in some countries other activities as well.
</p>
<p>
	To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
	parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
	a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
</p>
<p>
	An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
	to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
	feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
	tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
	extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
	work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
	the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
	menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
</p>
<p>
	1. Source Code.
</p>
<p>
	The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
	for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
	form of a work.
</p>
<p>
	A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
	standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
	interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
	is widely used among developers working in that language.
</p>
<p>
	The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
	than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
	packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
	Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
	Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
	implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
	"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
	(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
	(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
	produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
</p>
<p>
	The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
	the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
	work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
	control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
	System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
	programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
	which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
	includes interface definition files associated with source files for
	the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
	linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
	such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
	subprograms and other parts of the work.
</p>
<p>
	The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
	can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
	Source.
</p>
<p>
	The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
	same work.
</p>
<p>
	2. Basic Permissions.
</p>
<p>
	All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
	copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
	permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
	covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
	content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
	rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
</p>
<p>
	You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
	convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
	in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
	of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
	with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
	the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
	not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
	for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
	and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
</p>
<p>
	Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
	the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
	makes it unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
	3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
</p>
<p>
	No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
	measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
	11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
	similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
	measures.
</p>
<p>
	When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
	circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
	the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
	modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
	users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
	technological measures.
</p>
<p>
	4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
</p>
<p>
	You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
	keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
	non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
	keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
	recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
</p>
<p>
	You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
	and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
</p>
<p>
	5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
</p>
<p>
	You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
	produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
	terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>
<p>
	a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
	it, and giving a relevant date.
</p>
<p>
	b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
	released under this License and any conditions added under section
	7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
	"keep intact all notices".
</p>
<p>
	c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
	License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
	License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
	additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
	regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
	permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
	invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
</p>
<p>
	d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
	Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
	interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
	work need not make them do so.
</p>
<p>
	A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
	works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
	and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
	in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
	"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
	used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
	beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
	in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
	parts of the aggregate.
</p>
<p>
	6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
</p>
<p>
	You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
	of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
	machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
	in one of these ways:
</p>
<p>
	a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
	(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
	Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
	customarily used for software interchange.
</p>
<p>
	b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
	(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
	written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
	long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
	model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
	copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
	product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
	medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
	more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
	conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
	Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
</p>
<p>
	c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
	written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
	alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
	only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
	with subsection 6b.
</p>
<p>
	d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
	place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
	Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
	further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
	Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
	copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
	may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
	that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
	clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
	Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
	Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
	available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
</p>
<p>
	e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
	you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
	Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
	charge under subsection 6d.
</p>
<p>
	A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
	from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
	included in conveying the object code work.
</p>
<p>
	A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
	tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
	or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
	into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
	doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
	product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
	typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
	of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
	actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
	is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
	commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
	the only significant mode of use of the product.
</p>
<p>
	"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
	procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
	and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
	a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
	suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
	code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
	modification has been made.
</p>
<p>
	If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
	specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
	part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
	User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
	fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
	Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
	by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
	if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
	modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
	been installed in ROM).
</p>
<p>
	The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
	requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
	for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
	the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
	network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
	adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
	protocols for communication across the network.
</p>
<p>
	Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
	in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
	documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
	source code form), and must require no special password or key for
	unpacking, reading or copying.
</p>
<p>
	7. Additional Terms.
</p>
<p>
	"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
	License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
	Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
	be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
	that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
	apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
	under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
	this License without regard to the additional permissions.
</p>
<p>
	When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
	remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
	it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
	removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
	additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
	for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
</p>
<p>
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
	add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
	that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
</p>
<p>
	a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
	terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
</p>
<p>
	b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
	author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
	Notices displayed by works containing it; or
</p>
<p>
	c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
	requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
	reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
</p>
<p>
	d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
	authors of the material; or
</p>
<p>
	e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
	trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
</p>
<p>
	f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
	material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
	it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
	any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
	those licensors and authors.
</p>
<p>
	All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
	restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
	received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
	governed by this License along with a term that is a further
	restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
	a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
	License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
	of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
	not survive such relicensing or conveying.
</p>
<p>
	If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
	must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
	additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
	where to find the applicable terms.
</p>
<p>
	Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
	form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
	the above requirements apply either way.
</p>
<p>
	8. Termination.
</p>
<p>
	You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
	provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
	modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
	this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
	paragraph of section 11).
</p>
<p>
	However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
	license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
	provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
	finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
	holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
	prior to 60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>
	Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
	reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
	violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
	received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
	copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
	your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>
	Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
	licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
	this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
	reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
	material under section 10.
</p>
<p>
	9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
</p>
<p>
	You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
	run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
	occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
	to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
	nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
	modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
	not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
	covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
</p>
<p>
	10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
</p>
<p>
	Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
	receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
	propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
	for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
</p>
<p>
	An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
	organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
	organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
	work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
	transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
	licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
	give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
	Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
	the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
</p>
<p>
	You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
	rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
	not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
	rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
	any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
	sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
</p>
<p>
	11. Patents.
</p>
<p>
	A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
	License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
	work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
</p>
<p>
	A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
	owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
	hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
	by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
	but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
	consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
	purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
	patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
	this License.
</p>
<p>
	Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
	patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
	make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
	propagate the contents of its contributor version.
</p>
<p>
	In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
	agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
	(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
	sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
	party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
	patent against the party.
</p>
<p>
	If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
	and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
	to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
	publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
	then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
	available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
	patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
	consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
	license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
	actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
	covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
	in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
	country that you have reason to believe are valid.
</p>
<p>
	If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
	arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
	covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
	receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
	or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
	you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
	work and works based on it.
</p>
<p>
	A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
	the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
	conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
	specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
	work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
	in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
	to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
	the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
	parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
	patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
	conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
	for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
	contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
	or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
</p>
<p>
	Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
	any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
	otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
</p>
<p>
	12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
</p>
<p>
	If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
	covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
	not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
	to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
	the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
	License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
</p>
<p>
	13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
</p>
<p>
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
	permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
	under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
	combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
	License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
	but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
	section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
	combination as such.
</p>
<p>
	14. Revised Versions of this License.
</p>
<p>
	The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
	the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	address new problems or concerns.
</p>
<p>
	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
	Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
	Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
	option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
	version or of any later version published by the Free Software
	Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
	GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
	by the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
	If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
	versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
	public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
	to choose that version for the Program.
</p>
<p>
	Later license versions may give you additional or different
	permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
	author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
	later version.
</p>
<p>
	15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
</p>
<p>
	THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
	APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
	HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
	OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
	THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
	IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
	ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>
<p>
	16. Limitation of Liability.
</p>
<p>
	IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
	THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
	GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
	DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
	PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
	EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
	SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>
	17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
</p>
<p>
	If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
	above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
	reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
	an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
	Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
	copy of the Program in return for a fee.
</p>
<p>
	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
</p>
<p>
	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
</p>
<p>
	If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</p>
<p>
	To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
	state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</p>
<p>
	<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
	Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
</p>
<p>
	This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
	it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
	the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
	(at your option) any later version.
</p>
<p>
	This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
	but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
	MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
	GNU General Public License for more details.
</p>
<p>
	You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
	along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
</p>
<p>
	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</p>
<p>
	If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
	notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
</p>
<p>
	<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
		This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
		This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
		under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</p>
<p>
		The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
		parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
		might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
</p>
<p>
		You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
		if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
		For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
		<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
</p>
<p>
		The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
		into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
		may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
		the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
		Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
		<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

	This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
	<br />
	This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
	<br />

</p>
<p>
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	<br />
	SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
	<br />
	-----------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
	PREAMBLE
	<br />
	The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
	<br />
	development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
	<br />
	efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
	<br />
	open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
	<br />
	with others.
</p>
<p>
	The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
	<br />
	redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
	<br />
	fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
	<br />
	redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
	<br />
	names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
	<br />
	however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
	<br />
	requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
	<br />
	to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
</p>
<p>
	DEFINITIONS
	<br />
	&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
	<br />
	Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
	<br />
	include source files, build scripts and documentation.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the
	<br />
	copyright statement(s).
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
	<br />
	distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
	<br />
	or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
	<br />
	Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
	<br />
	new environment.
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
	<br />
	writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
</p>
<p>
	PERMISSION AND CONDITIONS
	<br />
	Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
	<br />
	a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
	<br />
	redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
	<br />
	Software, subject to the following conditions:
</p>
<p>
	1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
	<br />
	in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
</p>
<p>
	2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
	<br />
	redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
	<br />
	contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
	<br />
	included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
	<br />
	in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
	<br />
	binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
</p>
<p>
	3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
	<br />
	Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
	<br />
	Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
	<br />
	presented to the users.
</p>
<p>
	4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
	<br />
	Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
	<br />
	Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
	<br />
	Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
	<br />
	permission.
</p>
<p>
	5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
	<br />
	must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
	<br />
	distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to

<ol start="3">
	<li>
		Distribution Obligations.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	3.1. Application of License.
</p>
<p>
	The Modifications&nbsp;which&nbsp;You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However,&nbsp;You&nbsp;may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
</p>
<p>
	3.2. Availability of Source Code.
</p>
<p>
	Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
</p>
<p>
	3.3. Description of Modifications.
</p>
<p>
	You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
</p>
<p>
	3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
</p>
<p>
	 (a) Third Party Claims.
</p>
<p>
	 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
</p>
<p>
	 (b) Contributor APIs.
</p>
<p>
	 If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
</p>
<p>
	 (c) Representations.
</p>
<p>
	 Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
</p>
<p>
	3.5. Required Notices.
</p>
<p>
	You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a&nbsp;particular Source&nbsp;Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,&nbsp;You&nbsp;may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it&nbsp;absolutely clear&nbsp;than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
</p>
<p>
	3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
</p>
<p>
	You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,&nbsp;provided that&nbsp;You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it&nbsp;absolutely clear&nbsp;that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;any such terms You offer.
</p>
<p>
	3.7. Larger Works.
</p>
<p>
	You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,&nbsp;You&nbsp;must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
</p>
<ol start="4">
	<li>
		Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

</p>
<p>
	6.2. Effect of New Versions.
</p>
<p>
	Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,&nbsp;You&nbsp;may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
</p>
<p>
	6.3. Derivative Works.
</p>
<p>
	If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

		TERMINATION.

	8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
</p>
<p>
	8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding&nbsp;declatory&nbsp;judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging&nbsp;that:
</p>
<p>
	(a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60&nbsp;days notice&nbsp;from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the&nbsp;60 day&nbsp;notice period specified above.
</p>
<p>
	(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
</p>
<p>
	8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be&nbsp;taken into account&nbsp;in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
</p>
<p>
	8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor&nbsp;hereunderprior&nbsp;to termination shall survive termination.
